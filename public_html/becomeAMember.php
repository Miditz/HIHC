				<h3>Hamilton Devils (Club name)</h3>
				<p>The Hamilton Inline Hockey Club participates in the National Hockey League. The body which governs the sport in our country is the New Zealand Inline Hockey Association (NZIHA).  The country is divided into 4 regions – North, Central, Lower North and South.  The Hamilton Devils belong to the Central Region.</p>

				<h3>Central Region League</h3>
				<p>The hockey season lasts from March through until the end of October. During the months of March through August teams compete against each other within their own region. In our case this includes Hamilton, Morrinsville, Whakatane, Tauranga, New Plymouth, Taupo and Waihi. There are four venues currently available for League games in the Central Region; these are Hamilton, Waihi, Tauranga and New Plymouth.
				During the season teams are expected to play on a home and away basis. League games are normally played every weekend with the exception of school holidays, and are played on either a Saturday or a Sunday. Teams work together to make sure all players are at games, with parents taking turns at travelling to “away” games.</p>

				<h3>National Championships</h3>
				<p>The 2 top club teams in each grade from the Regional League or Regional Playoffs go through to the National Championships –These are normally held in the September school holidays.</p>

				<h3>Inter Regional Championship</h3>
				<p>At the beginning of the season, selectors are chosen by the Central Region for each grade. Nearing the end of the league season the selectors meet and decide who will be sent an invitation to trial for the Inter Regional team. Successful candidates from the trials will compete against the three other regions at the Inter Regional Championships – These championships are held over Labour Weekend.</p>

				<h3>New Zealand Teams</h3>
				<p>A trial is held each December where teams will be picked for the coming season of international games. New Zealand teams compete at the Oceania Championships held annually in New Zealand and Australia alternately, usually during the last week of the Easter holidays.</p>

				<h3>Tournaments</h3>
				<p>
				Throughout the year there are tournaments held at various locations. Participation is a club & team decision, and entry fees are not included in club subscription fees.
				</p>

				<h3>Grades</h3>
				<p>The following age grades apply:<br>
				Junior: Under 10, Under 12, Under 14, Under 16 (Junior)<br>
				Senior: Under 18, Under 20, Senior, Senior Women, Masters<br>
				Age is determined by the age of the player as at 1st January 2013.</p>

				<h3>Uniform & Gear</h3>
				<p>Players must have their own uniform pants, as specified by the club.  Shirts are supplied by the club or can be purchased from the club and personalised with the players own name and number.  Every player must have their own skates and safety approved protective gear, including helmet, shin guards, gloves and elbow guards.  A girdle or padded pants though not compulsory, is highly recommended. A protective cup for male players is mandatory.  Players & Goalies must have their own sticks, with a spare highly recommended in case of breakage during a game.</p>

				<h3>Training</h3>
				<p>Players are expected to attend at least one training session per week (see our Training page for our current schedule) during the regular season. This may increase if your teams qualify for higher honours.  Current training times are available on the web site or on the noticeboard. These will change once we have finalised the number of teams we have for the 2013 season. You are all welcome to attend your age group training. Cost is $5.00 per session.
