				<b>
					The Hamilton Devils inline hockey club was established in 1996 and competed in the first National competition that year. Through the hard work and dedication of our loyal club members over the years we still stand and couldn't have done it without them. After floating around a few locations the club settled in Sunshine Ave, Te Rapa for many years becoming the hotspot for things to do on a friday night without our weekly public skating. <br><br>
					Although Sunshine Ave was our home our little club had become somewhat cramped and plans begun in 2008 for a brand new rink. After months of fundraising the dream became a reality in  April 2010. The ground broke for in Lugdon Park just off Old Farm Road. The 4 walls we have today went up and volunteers from the club chipped in with any expertise they had to finish the inside shops, mezzanine and grand stand. <br><br>
					Since the completion of the building we have had many successful tournaments and games. Holding nationals many times it has been the highlight of the Hamilton Devils year with everyone from the country coming together and enjoy this fast paced game we all love.
